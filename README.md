Displaying the UK's solar energy production in MW visually \
Data is fetched from the University of Sheffield Solar API

# Inspiration
Winderful's website displaying the UK's wind energy production

# What it does
You can switch between displaying the last week. last month or last year's data.
The size of the sun changes depending on the value of the selected solar energy production

# Tech Stack
Next.js, Tailwind , HTML, CSS \
We experimented with Apex Charts but decided to code the graphs in Tailwind/CSS/JSX

# Challenges
Fetching data without CORS errors - switched project from React to Next.js so we could fetch data in a server component \
Mobile responsiveness \
Sizing the sun responsively

# Accomplishments
Glowing sun that changes size based on energy consumption / screensize

# What We Learned
How to make the size of the sun responsive using css grid \
Tailwind and Tailwind animations \
How to code a graph component
